Test environment for the doser:
A test run making use of all important data structures.
Creates mock hub nodes, devices, sensors and their data sources, data providers from data sources, environments, tasks and their schedules, and controllers.
Loads data and prints system lists and the system hierarchy, and then shows a simple tasking system.
Dependencies: wiringPi library used for delay(), compiles on windows when references to it are removed.
Entry point: main() at test_environment.c

Next steps:
Finalizing and prettying up test code for github.
Integrating the system with a console user interface.
Setting up network communications with hubs.
Building the web interface and backend.
